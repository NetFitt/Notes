////CHAPTER 2 LAYER 2 (SWITCHES)

/// STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) very important Protocol 802.1D

/PART ONE 

- when making 3 switches linked there will be a loop when send a packet throw this network 
- STP requires election to be preformed first, STP will find which ports should be opend
- STP is completly automatic
- every switch in cisco have a bridge-priority which is 32768 the switch that has the smallest will be prioratised and wont close its port
- bridge-priority can be edited since its by default always 32768
- if the switches all have same bridge-priority then it will priortise the switch with the lowest MAC address the winner will have 'Designated ports'
- the chosen switch its ports will stay open as well as the facing ports of these ports on other switches and these ports named 'ROOT BRIDGE'
- the closed port named the Alternative port : Blocking state.
- Bridge ID is Bridge-priority.Mac Address example : 32768.00:11:22:AA:BB:CC
- The winner must be : 1-Lowest Priority , 2-Lowest MAC Address
- the proccess of election take about (30 - 50)seconds
        MAX AGE = 20 + (Forwarding delay = 15) + (Learning Delay = 15) = 50 seconds
- NOTE: if one of the links is busted then the STP will start the election again which is bad since it takes 50secondes that means 50 secondes out of service

/PART TWO ep25

- In order to speed things up :
        Rapid STP RSTP(802.1W) : No Listening , No Blocking, Only (Discard, Forwarding ,Learning) then delay will become 3 + 3 = 6 seconds
- when having vlans you can make a vlan as root bridge so the STP will reelect (3rd generation)
        that will be called Per-VLAN STP (PVST) 802.1S
        Each VLAN can have its own Election!!!
        Each Vlan can have its own Root Bridge!
        Things are much better network

        Specially that there is a RPVST+ (faster)

- Now, Edge ports and Port Fast: whats the cases and diffrences?
        let's say you have an end device inside the 3 switches that require STP, you should assing the port of that end device as Edge port so it does not 
     enter the elections, Port fast if you want to keep a port always as designated port so it wont be blocked(however that's dangrous because you could chose the one that was gona be blocked then its gona be a loop)   

* Dont forget MST 802.1S (5th generation) : MST is made for groups of VLAN'S

/// CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol ) and LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) these protocols are automatic

- so the CDP is a protocol to know the neighbors that are connected and in which device in which port and with its information's
- these info are like this :
        My port that is connected to it 
        its port that is connected to me
        the IP address of the neighbor device 
        the MAC address of the neighbor device 
        port description of the neighbor
- you can change names of each port 
- CDP works only on cisco devices but LLDP works on all devices even cisco devices

///LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) PORT CHANNEL

- this protocol make 2 to 8 ports to function as one port to add to the bandwidth of the cable
- in some devices must be serialized the ports like (1-2-3 ..etc) some dont need to 
- to have this protocol one of the devices must be ACTIVE


////CHAPTER 3 LAYER 3 (Routers) STATIC , OSPF thats what is learned in CCNA

/STATIC Routing

- IP Connectivity : RTP is old , OSPF need about 50%,EIGRP is rare now a days , BGP is taken out, IS-IS all of these are protocols for the layer three devices which are mainly Routers
- Routing is reciveing the packets study the destination how many switchs and routers in the way then send it 

- Static Route : the only way is manualy routre a specific packet to a specific route
- the first next-hop can either be the egress interface port ID or, the next reachable IP Address
- Available for IPv4 and IPv6
- can route a host ex:192.168.1.1/32 thts one device or a network 

- Static route Flavores : 
        Default Route : every un-mentioned subnet to be routed here , also, can be default Gateaway
        Floating Static : a hidden back-up plan
                -to make Floating Static theres conditions: 
                the Static route must have AD of 1 (so that the static always will have priority)
                the AD number should have a number less than other protocols like OSPF EIGRP so its better if you keep it beween 1-89
                

/DYNAMIC Routing (OSPF Open Shortest-Path First) ep 36

- Administrative Distance AD = 110
- Metric = Cost (lesser=better) = 10^8 / bandwidth (kb/s)
- Dijkstra algorithm
- SPF algorithm for route decision
- Process ID for multiple instances 
- Area ID for Data Base isolaton 
        using area's all areas must be connected to the area number 0, if not then OSPF wont work on that area 

- Link-State Advertisements LSA: negotiation between OSPF Routers
        It contains: LSRequest:Provides the missing information
                     LSUpdate:Replys to the LSR
                     LSAcknowledgment: Reply to LSU 
NOTE: LS Data base LSDB is in every router of the network that use OSPF

- Neighboring Process
        - P2P Neighboring Process : no problems here
        - can be connected throw a switch !!
                Broadcast will happen
                Elections will take place (these elections to chose a DR which is automatic )
                Only One router should update the topology (DR)

                A DR (Designated Router): Highest Router Priority (0-255) ,Default = 128 or highest RID (router id)
                Router ID (RID):32bit address
        - DR needs BDR Back-up DR (second best of every thing) 
        - other router are DR others 
        - relations 
                DR <--> all = full adjacent 
                BDR <--> all = full adjacent
                DROther <--> DROther = neighbor, the relation stop at 2 way step (look at the OSPF image) 

/// CHAPTER 4 IP services (10 very important Protocols for layer 3)

/DHCP (Dynamic Host-Configuration Protocol)
- A Dynamic/Autumatic method to assing IP addresses
- Not only IP addresses:
        - Subnet Maskes 
        - Gateaway
        - DNS!!

- what's a DNS ? 
        - Domain Name server: resolve a URL to an ip Address and vice-versa
        - works on UDP port 53
        - also , there is a reverse DNS (for )

- DHCP assignments of the ip address will last 24h if the computer still connected and using it after 24h will keep it

IMPORTANT
- what if the first router (Gateaway) wasn't a DHCP Server ?
        - there will be a "helper-address"
        - known as DHCP relay 
        - help redirecting the Broadcast messages from first Gateaway to the correct DHCP server
                -to do that theres a command to add the other routers gateaway so they send DHCP messages to the pool router
                -in order to make a DHCP Relay you have to connect the two router's using static routing or OSPF 

/FHRP (First Hop Redundency Protocol *a family of protocols*) in CCNA (no LAB)

- what if the gateaway went down 
- another gateway must be in place but how to redirect a message from one to another
- how many backups can there be ? this depends on which protocol of the three
- the protocls that can do this are: 
        -HSRP (Hot Stand-by RP)
                - cisco only
                - 2 Gateways
                - No Load-Balancing
        -VRRP (Virtual-Router RP)
                - Open Standard
                - 2 Gateways
                - No Load-Balancing
        -GLBP (Gateaway Load Balancing P)
                - Cisco only
                - 4 Gateways
                - Load-Balancing

/NAT (Network Address Translation) only 2types in CCNA

- to give your networks the ability to access the internet which means this technology is very important .
- Public ip address cant be assinged to Private devices
- so here is what is gona happen ,in the router the engneer will add to it the public ip addresses that the company bought
and when a device want to connect to the internet it will trade its private ip with the public AND VICE-VERSA that what NAT DOES
- NAT has more than one type (3 Types)
        - Static NAT : one-one translating by hand
        - Dynamic NAT : Group-Group translating (almost like DHCP pools)
        
        this did not solve anything since there may be thousands of private address however public addresses are valuable and cant buy alot of theme 
this does alot of exauxte to public addresses So here it comes :
- PAT (Port Address Translation) also called NAPT or NAT-overlord
- PAT will do a one to 65535 translation
        so what happens is one port that have 1 ip public address get splited to 65535 virtual ports which means 65535 devices can use it
for example: 192.168.1.2 ---> 5.10.10.10:10     <<< vertual port is 10

NOTE:   Private ip addresses cant have internet
        NAT does not work on multi layer switch only ROUTERS

/NTP (Network Time Protocol)

- Gives a percise information, with real timing and date either by setting an inner clock manualy or asking someone to 
informe us about us 
- uses UDP = 123

- each network device (router) in a network has to be either a Server or a Client
- Stratum is needed: 
        -how preferred and accurate this source is
        -starts from 0 - 15
        -the closest, the better
        -by default: a cisco router = 8

/SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) has no LAB

- Monitor networks from a single point of view
- uses UDP 161 / 162 (in some cases)
- the server is the three requester (and recorder)

- at the agent side:
        - MIB object (the factory)
        - Agent (The Messenger)
-SNMP versions: 
        - v1 :obsolete
        - v2c : enhanced
        - v3 : supports Authentication & Encryption  

/Syslog (System Logging) NO LAB

- Stay aware of "everything"
- Know all what's happening behind the science (or even in front of you!!)
- starts from obvious informations up to "Emergencies"
- Server/Client Relationship

- Server can be a Normal server that collects all the information
- Server can use the "Syslog" or "Splunk" software
- client is the networking device that generates logs 

- Quote: "Every Awesome Cisco Engineer Will need ice-cream daily" must memorize these :
        0 - Emergency
        1 - Alert
        2 - Critical
        3 - Error 
        4 - Warning 
        5 - Notification
        6 - Information 
        7 - Debug

/QOS (Quality of Service) ep51

- This is used to control the band width of the services for example i have my own network and my client's network 
i rather loose some of the band width on my network than the client lossing it so if congection will happen any ways
i perefer some traffics than others to have the band width

- Generaly UDP will be preferred than TCP (TCP autamoticly do a retransmistion)
- QOS will prefer based on vareity of factors , some are:
        (Classification , Marking , Queueing , Shaping , and Policing)
-Classification & Marking :
        classifying the traffic according to its importants
        (Very High , High , Medium , Low)
-Queueing 
        - Giving a specific priority every type of packet 
        (giving the the priority of 'very high' to UDP traffic)
        -Diving the Transmission capacity with respect to the priority
        (giving 40% to the very high ,20% to the high ,etc)
-Policing & Shaping:
        -Policing is counting the traffic befor transmiting it , and limiting it 
        (limit the FTP traffic to be transmitted at maximum of only 2Mbps)
        -Shaping limits the Queued traffic to a certain amount of traffic.
        and what EXECEEDS,wait at the queue

/SSH (Secure Shell)

-A secured and trusted method to log in a device remotely
- uses TCP 22
- encrypt the transmitted information
- uses the server/client Relationship
- a replacement for telnet
- needs an application for (Microsoft Windows Users)

/FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

- data like files, software images, Configs saved as text's 
- FTP uses TCP 20.21!
- 2 TCP ports for 2 reasons:
        - TCP 20 (Control Channel):to establish connection between 
                Server and Client 
        - TCP 20 (Data Channel):to transfer Data between
                Server and Client
- there is a relative:
        -Trivial FTP (TFTP)
        -uses UDP 69
        -UDP so, unreliable, but still has its uses

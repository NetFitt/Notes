////CHAPTER 2 LAYER 2 (SWITCHES)

/// STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) very important Protocol 802.1D

/PART ONE 

- when making 3 switches linked there will be a loop when send a packet throw this network 
- STP requires election to be preformed first, STP will find which ports should be opend
- STP is completly automatic
- every switch in cisco have a bridge-priority which is 32768 the switch that has the smallest will be prioratised and wont close its port
- bridge-priority can be edited since its by default always 32768
- if the switches all have same bridge-priority then it will priortise the switch with the lowest MAC address the winner will have 'Designated ports'
- the chosen switch its ports will stay open as well as the facing ports of these ports on other switches and these ports named 'ROOT BRIDGE'
- the closed port named the Alternative port : Blocking state.
- Bridge ID is Bridge-priority.Mac Address example : 32768.00:11:22:AA:BB:CC
- The winner must be : 1-Lowest Priority , 2-Lowest MAC Address
- the proccess of election take about (30 - 50)seconds
        MAX AGE = 20 + (Forwarding delay = 15) + (Learning Delay = 15) = 50 seconds
- NOTE: if one of the links is busted then the STP will start the election again which is bad since it takes 50secondes that means 50 secondes out of service

/PART TWO ep25

- In order to speed things up :
        Rapid STP RSTP(802.1W) : No Listening , No Blocking, Only (Discard, Forwarding ,Learning) then delay will become 3 + 3 = 6 seconds
- when having vlans you can make a vlan as root bridge so the STP will reelect (3rd generation)
        that will be called Per-VLAN STP (PVST) 802.1S
        Each VLAN can have its own Election!!!
        Each Vlan can have its own Root Bridge!
        Things are much better network

        Specially that there is a RPVST+ (faster)

- Now, Edge ports and Port Fast: whats the cases and diffrences?
        let's say you have an end device inside the 3 switches that require STP, you should assing the port of that end device as Edge port so it does not 
     enter the elections, Port fast if you want to keep a port always as designated port so it wont be blocked(however that's dangrous because you could chose the one that was gona be blocked then its gona be a loop)   

* Dont forget MST 802.1S (5th generation) : MST is made for groups of VLAN'S

/// CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol ) and LLDP (Link Layer Discovery Protocol) these protocols are automatic

- so the CDP is a protocol to know the neighbors that are connected and in which device in which port and with its information's
- these info are like this :
        My port that is connected to it 
        its port that is connected to me
        the IP address of the neighbor device 
        the MAC address of the neighbor device 
        port description of the neighbor
- you can change names of each port 
- CDP works only on cisco devices but LLDP works on all devices even cisco devices

///LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol) PORT CHANNEL

- this protocol make 2 to 8 ports to function as one port to add to the bandwidth of the cable
- in some devices must be serialized the ports like (1-2-3 ..etc) some dont need to 
- to have this protocol one of the devices must be ACTIVE


////CHAPTER 3 LAYER 3 (Routers) STATIC , OSPF thats what is learned in CCNA

- IP Connectivity : RTP is old , OSPF need about 50%,EIGRP is rare now a days , BGP is taken out, IS-IS all of these are protocols for the layer three devices which are mainly Routers
- Routing is reciveing the packets study the destination how many switchs and routers in the way then send it
